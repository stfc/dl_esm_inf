# Makefile for the example mini-app demonstrating the use of the dl_esm_inf
# library.
#
# This Makefile picks up the compiler to use plus any associated flags from
# environment variables. e.g. to use gfortran:
# 
# export F90=mpif90
# export F90FLAGS="-O3"
# export AR=ar
# make
#
# or, to build the serial version:
#
# export F90=gfortran
# make serial-model

all: model

# Target to build version with MPI support
.PHONY: model
model: inf_lib model.exe

# Target to build serial version
.PHONY: serial-model
serial-model: inf_lib_serial model.exe

# Run tests (check both serial and parallel versions are valgrind clean)
# This is a very basic target and assumes that valgrind and 'mpirun'
# are available.
# TODO use a proper testing framework!
test: serial-test
